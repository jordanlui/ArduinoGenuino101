# Arduino 101 Genuino 101 Updated Scripts

This repo host updated scripts that work for Arduino 101 Genuino 101 boards with the newer Intel Cuire Boards 2.0.2 and library drivers like CurieIMU 1.0.0

If you see any errors please send me a message! The Arduino 101 is a powerful board but the lack of updated code tutorials for these boards has left me frustrated. I hope this can help you!
